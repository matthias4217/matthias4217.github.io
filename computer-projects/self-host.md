## Hardware

I have started hosting my own services on four machines :
  * one physical server, with 2GB of memory and 500GB of storage (at home, not always running)
  * one virtual server, with 1GB memory and 20GB of storage (with Yunohost)
  * one virtual server, with 4GB memory and 80GB of storage (fedora and docker)
  * one virtual server, with 2GB memory and 1To of storage (to store large amounts of files)

In addition, I manage a Minecraft server.

## Software

The servers I manage are either installed with Yunohost, to ease the administration, or barebone with Fedora and Docker.
I host various services : static websites, Nextcloud instance, Mediawiki...
This is both a great opportunity to learn, and to free myself from surveillance capitalism and modern monopolies such as the GAFAM.
