*Grow & Rest* is a contemplative game made with Unity3D.
This was our [Unijam 2019](https://itch.io/jam/unijam2019) submission, and it won the Concept Prize, for its inventivity and respect of the theme.

This game was made with [Pierre "Debiantarte" Bidault](https://debiantarte.github.io/), [Tristan Charial](http://tcharial.mmi-angouleme.fr) and [Valentin Forestier](https://valforestiergamedev.wixsite.com/).
