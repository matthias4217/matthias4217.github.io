I enjoy various artistic activities.

I sometimes write :

  * [Talecember 2021](https://talecember.kestrels-and-roses.rocks/2021/) : a worldbuilding project made with a couple of friends (in french and english)
  * [Suggestion d'Ã©criture du 2021-06-02](/art-projects/suggestion-ecriture-2021-06-02) : a short story (in french) written following a writing prompt
  * [December Worldbuilding 2020](https://talecember.kestrels-and-roses.rocks/2020/) : a worldbuilding project made with a couple of friends (in french)
  * [Hunting Grounds](/art-projects/hunting-grounds) : a short story (in french) written for an art festival
