![Biome - Hero with sword against devillish beast](/assets/img/projects/biome/biome-image-representative.png)
Biome is a prototype 3D-roguelike, made in C# with Unity3D.
It features a procedurally-generated terrain, and enemies adapting to the player's behaviour.

This project was made with Luke Austin, Timothée Denoux, [Romain Derré](https://github.com/Rom-s), Adrien Floriant.

### Installation

You can download the game from here (Googel Drive) :
  * [Linux 64-bits](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aaX3BJHE8PcKgXqyBLAymf-x4hcIHIwE?usp=sharing)
  * [Windows 64-bits](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FabYI5S_Gg3qXji2IRcAdgajFSRaVE0j?usp=sharing)

### Usage
At the beginning of the game, tips are displayed to remind you of the controls. The full list is also below :
  * ZQSD/Arrows : Movement
  * Mouse : Rotate camera
  * Left mouse click : Attack
  * E : Grab/Drop the sword
  * Space : Roulade (esquive)

It is also possible to use a controller (only tested with an xBox, not with a Sony controller).
Movement is then made with the left stick, and camera orientation with the right one.
The attack can be made with the X button or with the upper right trigger.
Dropping or taing the sword is done with Y.

The binaries also include debug tools.
The following keys are used (only with a keyboard) :

  * L : Trigger debug interface (log and debug buttons on screen)
  * I : Trigger player invincibility
  * R : Reset status and position of the player
  * G : Link the sword to the player
  * P : Pause game
  * C : Change camera
  * B : Force adaptation of enemies
  * V : Force enemy spawn
  * N : Despawn an enemy
  * F : Freeze all enemies
  * W : Stop enemy spawn
