[Ponysay](https://github.com/erkin/ponysay/) is a nice software which prints ponies as colorful unicode art in a terminal.
It has been designed to handle character from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, as well as some unofficial ponies.
However, it can handle all kind of images, given they are not too big.
The only inconveniant is that metadata do not suit anything else well.

But I wanted to have more than ponies.
I've thus started to collect and convert sprites so that it could be displayed with ponysay.
Most of the art isn't from me (see [the artists](https://framagit.org/matthias4217/custom-ponysay/-/blob/master/ARTISTS.md), but I did adapt them so that they display nicely.
I am currently working on Steven Universe characters, but I will eventually add many more characters from many universes.
Contributions are welcomed.
