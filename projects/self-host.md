## Hardware

I have started hosting my own services on three machines :
  * one physical server, with 2GB of memory and 500GB of storage
  * one virtual server, with 1GB memory and 20GB of storage
  * one virtual server, with 4GB memory and 80GB of storage

In addition, I manage one Minecraft server.

## Software

The servers I manage are either installed with Yunohost, to ease the administration, or barebone with Fedora.
I host various services : static websites, Nextcloud instance, Mediawiki...
This is both a great opportunity to learn, and to free myself from capitalist monopolies such as the GAFAM.
